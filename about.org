I am a Senior Software Engineer at [[http://irongalaxystudios.com/][Iron Galaxy Orlando LLC]]. I graduated from [[https://www.ucf.edu/][University of Central Florida]] with a MS Interactive Entertainment in 2012 and a B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering from [[https://www.amrita.edu/][Amrita School of Engineering]] in 2011. \\

Also, if it's not obvious from looking at my website I'm not much of a web designer.
