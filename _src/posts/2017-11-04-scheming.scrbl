I recently switched to using emacs as my default text editor primarily because I was fascinated by
@hyperlink["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTwQvgfgMM" "org-mode"]. I've been enjoying messing
around with lisps, escpecially scheme. Racket has been a wonderful playground and I've been
using it to create all kinds of little tools. It has become my python replacement.
